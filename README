# Calculator Pracice project
I wrote an extremely basic calculator in order to learn java.

## To Run
- Clone this repo
- Make sure java + Maven + Make is installed
- Run the make commands, `make install`, `make`

To run the program without the test, `make debug` exists.
This was written in Windows, but should work just fine on Linux.

## How it works
- Tokenize an expression stream
- Build an ast of the entire expression
- Crunch the tree

While I don't want to claim I intentionally wrote bad code, I did try to do things in multiple different and roundabout ways to try learning more things.
